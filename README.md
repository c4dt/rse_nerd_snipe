# Nerd Sniping Coffees

[RSECon25](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/) has been a treat - both the organizational tracks and the
technical tracks were really fun.
And as always, the hallway track was even better - even though I really have to work on writing down 
people's names!
Sorry for the folks I didn't recognize from last years :(

On the last day, Sam Tygier [Nerd Sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) me - well, he was decent enough to not
do it on a road crossing.
But putting me on a mathematical quest on a drinking / board gaming evening was nerd-sniping.
The question was about how to organize 1-1 meetings for a group of RSEs, in such a way that 
no pair repeats over a number of weeks.

Turns out it's not as easy as it sounds first - read more here:

Thanks to Sam Tygier for the idea, and Warrick Ball for initial support.
